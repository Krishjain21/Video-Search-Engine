# Video Search Engine

The Video Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for videos and view the search results. It includes two HTML files, two CSS files, and a JavaScript file.

## Files

- `try.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application. It contains the search form and displays the search results.
- `preview.html`: An HTML file that displays the selected video preview and provides options to visit the video link or close the preview overlay.
- `try.css`: The main CSS file that defines the styles for the application.
- `preview.css`: A CSS file specifically for styling the preview window.
- `app.js`: A javascript file to provide functionality to the try.html file and and for preview.html I have include the script in html file itself.

Due the lack of time its a little buggy but the main fucntionality works properly.
